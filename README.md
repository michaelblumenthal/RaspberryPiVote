# RaspberryPiVote
Source Code for my Windows 10 IoT Core Universal Windows App that runs on a Raspberry Pi 2.  It's a demo app that uses the metaphor of voting to show basic functions like writing to GPIO pins and reading and writing REST Services. See http://bit.ly/IoTFun for details.
This code base works with Windows 10 build 14939 (the 2016 Anniversary Update). At this point, it is for experimenting with a better UI and does not have any GPIO funtionality.
See my other repository, RP2-Dounpour2.0- for working code - well at least code that works with Windows 10 build 10586.
